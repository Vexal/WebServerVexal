WebServerVexal
==============

main() is in WebServerVexal.cpp

The Server class (Server.cpp / Server.h) handles client connections and invoking web apps.

WebPageApp serves web pages.

AssemblerWebApp does the assembling web app for that assembler and simulator I wrote.

VimWebApp allows people to like and share code from VIM to facebook.

The SerialHandler and WebSockets are for interfacing with the Arduino board connected to my server.


The other files do things.
