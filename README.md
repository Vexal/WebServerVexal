WebServerVexal
==============

main() is in WebServerVexal.cpp

The Server class (Server.cpp / Server.h) handles client connections and invoking web apps.

WebPageApp serves web pages.

AssemblerWebApp does the assembling web app for that assembler and simulator I wrote.

VimWebApp allows people to like and share code from VIM to facebook.

The other files do things.
